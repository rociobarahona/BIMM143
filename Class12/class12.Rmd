```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}

library(bio3d)
file.name <- get.pdb("1hsg")
hiv <- read.pdb(file.name)

```

Q1: What is the name of the two non protein resid values in this structure? What does resid
correspond to and how would you get a listing of all reside values in this structure?
-HOH and MK1

## Select out protein only and ligand only

```{r}

prot <- trim.pdb(hiv, "protein")
lig <- trim.pdb(hiv, "ligand")
write.pdb(prot, file="1hsg_protein.pdb")
write.pdb(lig, "1hsg_ligand.pdb")

```


Write out these new PDB files so we can use them for docking.

```{r}

write.pdb(lig, "1hsg_ligand.pdb")
write.pdb(prot, "1hsg_protein.pdb")

```
